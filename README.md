### üìù About The Project

This project is an interactive platform prototype that allows users to discover car listings by swiping right (like) or left (pass) on a mobile-first interface, similar to Tinder. Users can add their own listings, save their liked listings as favorites, start chats with listing owners, and view other users or events on a map.

The project was built from scratch using modern React principles and hooks (`useReducer`, `useContext`), and styled with `CSS Modules` without relying on a UI component library.
